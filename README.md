Fuzzy Framework for Architecture Selection

This module includes several classes for the creation of various types of fuzzy systems, 
as well as functions for their training and deployment into a multi-disciplinary framework. 

This version is available publicly here in support of my dissertation. 

The core module pieces still need some cleaning and added documention.
